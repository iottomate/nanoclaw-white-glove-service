# NanoClaw White-Glove Service

*Deploy and maintain your team's AI assistant — remotely, worldwide, secured from day one.*

White-glove **NanoClaw** deployment for founders and exec teams. No technical knowledge required — we handle the install, hardening, integrations, and ongoing care so you can focus on running your business. Built for 4–50+ employee teams where the CEO/CFO/Head of Sales needs leverage without creating new security risk.

---

## Built For

**Founders & CEOs**
Drowning in email, calendar chaos, need leverage

**Exec Teams**
CFO, Head of Sales, EA — each gets their own agent

**Agencies & Studios**
Client workflows, reporting, project management

**Investors & VCs**
Deal flow tracking, portfolio updates, LP comms

---

## Always On, Always Working

Unlike ChatGPT or Claude Desktop, your NanoClaw agent runs **24/7 on dedicated infrastructure**. It wakes up on schedule, checks your WhatsApp, email, calendar, and connected tools — and takes action without you asking.

**Every 30 minutes**
Scans your inbox, flags urgent messages, drafts replies for your review

**9:00 AM daily**
Sends you a briefing: today's meetings, attendee backgrounds, prep notes

**On demand**
"I'm running 10 min late" → bot messages your next meeting and reschedules

**Ongoing**
Monitors WhatsApp groups, summarizes threads, surfaces what matters

You talk to your bot through **WhatsApp** (or Telegram, Slack, Discord) — just like texting an assistant. No technical knowledge required.

---

## What's an "Executive Agent"?

**1 Executive Agent = 1 NanoClaw instance** configured for one primary identity (CEO inbox/calendar, CFO inbox, Head of Sales, shared EA inbox). This keeps pricing fair and security boundaries clean.

Most 4–50 employee teams deploy **2–6 agents**: a CEO bot managing email and calendar, a Sales bot handling CRM and outreach, a Finance bot tracking invoices — all coordinating through shared context.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Kickoff Call
We discuss your goals, map your integrations (email, calendar, CRM, messaging), and plan your agent's workflows. You tell us what to automate — we handle the rest.

### 2. Deploy & Harden
We set up your Mac Mini (or VPS), install NanoClaw, configure secure OAuth, connect your tools, set up container sandboxing, firewall rules, and scheduled tasks. You go live same day.

### 3. 14-Day Hypercare
We tune workflows, expand permissions as you build trust, fix edge cases, and make sure everything runs smoothly. Dedicated support channel for direct help.

---

## Why Teams Hire Us

NanoClaw is open-source — you *could* set it up yourself. But most teams need custom integrations beyond the defaults, and even experienced engineers spend several hours getting everything wired up. Then there's the **ongoing maintenance**: updates, drift, broken workflows, security patches.

We handle all of it — deployed securely from day one, following security best practices, so your team gets **leverage instead of another project to maintain**. It's the Collison Install — we show up and do it for you.

---

## Security-First by Design

Your bot never sees raw credentials. We use secure OAuth middleware — all tokens are managed separately with a full audit trail and instant revoke capability. **Container sandboxing, firewall hardening, exec allowlists, and strict permission boundaries** keep your data safe.

**Privacy-first architecture:**
- Data stays on YOUR hardware, never cloud
- Container isolation for each WhatsApp group
- Read-only access between contexts
- Zero knowledge of your credentials
- Full audit trail of all actions

Unlike cloud AI services, your conversations and data never leave your infrastructure.
